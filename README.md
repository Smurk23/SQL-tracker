# SQL-tracker

In this challenge i was able to use my knowledge of SQL databases to create an employee tracker. In this challenge i present the user with many options such as get all employees, add employee, add role, and more! 

When a user makes a choice then the corresponding function is invoked and what was asked for is presented. (i.e. if a user selects "get all employees" then a list of all employees is returned) i was able to use queries and call back functions to achieve this.
